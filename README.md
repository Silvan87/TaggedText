This project has several goals set at different levels:
- The most specific goal is to have a simple syntax focused on the content that allows to also write templates with the same syntax and produce any type of publication that is in text format.
- At the same time, it is a teaching example on how to write a small software following all the good practices for a professional result:
  - agile software lifecycle with tracking of *user stories*;
  - *clean code* principles for maintainable code;
  - *technical documentation* to continue software development and providing tests according to the *Behaviour-Driven Development* (BDD) approach;
  - *user manual* for the end user.
- Finally, through moments of reflection that can be associated with the retrospectives of agile methods, I'd like to criticize and refine the agile method itself, followed throughout the development of this software, to give shape to a method suitable for similar projects, that is, small in size, but trying to keep an eye on scalability.

Depending on the purpose you are interested in, you can choose which introduction to follow:
- I'd like to see some examples of the TaggedText syntax and understand how to use it. **TO DO**
- I'd like to have an introduction to the development of this tool so I can contribute. **TO DO**
- I'd like to have an introduction to the agile method used and matured so far with this project. **TO DO**
- I'd like to have an overview of the programming practices applied in this project. **TO DO**
