                    <p>The syntax must be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>simple</b> to read for a human, possibly understandable "at a glance".</li>
                        <li><b>minimal</b>, i.e. use the minimum number of special characters and conventions while not limiting expressiveness.</li>
                        <li><b>comfortable</b>, the main aid to the use of this language will be the highlighting of the text, except for this it must be possible to write as simple text without the need of complex tools such as development environments.</li>
                        <li>broadly <b>expressive</b>, the html language can be used as a reference for expressiveness. It must be possible to define a textual content by qualifying the pieces of text with an adjective (or a tag). These chunks of text can be arbitrarily defined in number, length, start of substring and end of substring. These qualified (or tagged) pieces of text must be able to be inserted into a hierarchical structure with as many levels as the user needs.</li>
                        <li><b>focused on content</b> and therefore <b>flexible</b>, with a view to having models for generating layouts and graphics, the syntax should semantically qualify the parts of the text so to use them with great freedom at a later time, one should not feel the need to think about the arrangement of the contents, at most just a sequential order of the same.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For the initial developments, where code refactoring may be frequent and have a significant impact, the E2E testing approach will be used. Since there is no UI for the TT libraries, the method called to fulfill the user's initial command will be the starting point for E2E tests, and the files produced by that method will be the endpoint to verify if what has been produced corresponds to the expected output.</p>
                    <p>Once the code organization becomes more mature, the Test-Driven Development method will also be adopted to cover approximately 80% of the developed methods or those methods for which testing input and output is most significant.</p>
                    <p>Every architectural pattern that can avoid code repetitions, facilitate function extensibility, and ensure long-term code maintenance must be used. Code and its documentation must progress hand in hand.</p>
                    <p>The expected working examples, in accordance with the produced documentation, should cover: normal text, first and second level tagged text, in-line tagged text, tags without content, file-opening and file-ending rules (with sub rules: text, space, new-line, from-next-tag, from-var, from-file), rules for a tag (with sub rules: content, text, space, new-line, from-subtag, from-next-tag, from-var, from-file).</p>
